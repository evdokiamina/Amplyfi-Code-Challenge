By Richard Robert and Olivier Daniélo Contrary to its neighbors and partly due to the low cost of its nuclear electricity, until recently France did not show much interest in solar energy. The country now seems to be catching up. Public policies are implemented, both to encourage households and to foster an industry which has not yet reached maturity. Only thing is, one can hardly make sense of some of these policies. The politicians involved seem to suffer from confusion between communication and policy maki","m_szDocBody":"france solar road originally published review richard robert olivier danilo contrary
