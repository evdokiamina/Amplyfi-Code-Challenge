When I was about 10, I recall hearing that nuclear fusion power would become a reality \"in about thirty years\". The estimate has increased steadily since then, and now, forty odd years on, we hear that fusion power will come on-stream \"in about fifty years\". So, what is the real likelihood of fusion-based power stations coming to our aid in averting the imminent energy crisis?
